    "**Implementation note:** In steps 2 and 3 above, we need to compute $\\textstyle f'(z^{(l)}_i)$ for each value of $\\textstyle i$. Assuming $\\textstyle f(z)$ is the sigmoid activation function, we would already have $\\textstyle a^{(l)}_i$ stored away from the forward pass through the network. Thus, using the expression that we worked out earlier for $\\textstyle f'(z)$, we can compute this as $\\textstyle f'(z^{(l)}_i) = a^{(l)}_i (1- a^{(l)}_i)$.\n",
